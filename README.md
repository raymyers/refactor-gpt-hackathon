# RefactorGPT

Refactoring recommendation AI chat for the LabLab CustomGPT hackathon

## Demo

* [RefactorGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ncfYMqHTO-refactorgpt) in the OpenAI GPTs store.
* Or copy prompt.txt into your favorite chat interface.


## Implementation notes
We pivoted from a [version](https://github.com/raymyers/RefactorGPT-old) based on LangChain [OpenGPTs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts). In the process of developing that version we found at least 2 bugs in OpenGPTs for dealing with code in chat input. We intend to contribute fixes upstream.
